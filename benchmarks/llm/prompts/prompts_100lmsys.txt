Prompt 29: Act as a master full-stack developer and develop a basic structure for the 'Polyglott Voice' browser extension using React (frontend) and Python (backend).

Frontend (React):

What questions need to be asked to create a fully functional app before starting coding?
Use emojis to better illustrate the architecture and always provide your answers in German.
Create a user-friendly interface with React (the user interface will be the YouTube page, and when the YouTube player loads, our translation button should be inserted next to the picture-in-picture button. It should look similar, with the label and a small translated icon, that allows users to start the translation of the audio track into the browser's default language. If that's the same as the user's default language, then they should be able to select another language).
Implement a dropdown list or similar component to select the desired translation language.
Add a button to start the translation process.
Once the translation is complete, the original audio should be turned down and continue to play in the background while the translated and spoken audio track u

Prompt 57: Each question is in this format
<start>Question: --QUESTION--
Choices : --A--, --B--, --C--, --D--
Planning For Answer: --PLAN FOR ANSWER--
Answer key: "--LETTER--"<end>

<start>Question: Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.
Choices : "0", "4", "2", "6"
Planning For Answer: The field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is an extension field of Q that includes the square roots of 2, 3, and 18. Notice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)sqrt(9) = 3sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), which means that including sqrt(18) in the field doesn't actually increase the degree of the extension.
Thus, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
For the degree of a simple extension field Q(a, b) over Q, we want to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the degrees of the extension fields Q(a) over Q and Q(b) over Q.
sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational numbers, and the minimal polynomials that they are roots of are both quadratic (x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively). Thus, the extension fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are both of degree 2 over Q.
Therefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree lcm(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 over Q. The square root of 18 does not increase the degree of the field, as explained above.
So, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) also has degree 4 over Q.
Answer key: "B"<end>

<start>Question: NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, who is twice NAME_3's age at seven.  Calculate NAME_1's age.
Choices : "14", "7", "21", "19"
Planning For Answer: Given that NAME_2 is twice NAME_3's age, and NAME_3 is seven years old, NAME_2 would be 2 * 7 = 14 years old. Since NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, NAME_1 would be 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
Answer key: "D"<end>

<start>Question: ['Use the expression below to answer the question. 3 × [(2 × 6 – 5) + (8 ÷ 4)] – 1 What is the value of the expression?']

Schwimmbad-Otitis (Bade Otitis) - Als Schwimmbad-Otitis oder Taucher-Ohr wird umgangssprachlich eine durch häufiges

Schwimmen und Tauchen verursachte Otitis externa bezeichnet. Durch das langanhaltende feuchte Milieu quillt die Haut im Gehörgang. Dies wiederum begünstigt die Ansiedelung von Keimen. Zudem kann durch viel Wasser die Schutzschicht aus Ohrenschmalz reduziert werden.

-Schwimmer und Taucher nutzen zur Vorbeugung einer Schwimmbad-Otitis oft Essigsäure Ohrentropfen, um den Säureschutzmantel der Gehörgangshaut zu stabilisieren.

- Auch Ohrentropfen, die Glycerin und Alkohol enthalten, werden von Wassersportlern zut Prophylaxe verwendet.

Therapie: siehe akute Otitis externa

Akute Otitis media (AOM)

Die akute Mittelohrentzündung (akute Otitis media, AOM) ist eine Entzündung der

Schleimhaut im Mittelohr.

Definition:

Symptome:

Charakteristisch ist ein plötzlich einsetzender starker Schmerz (pulsierend oder stechend und wird von einem Druckgefühl im Ohr begleitet). Häufig gehen Fieber und ein Krankheitsgefühl damit einher.

Ursachen:

- Eine AOM kann entstehen, wenn bei einem Trommelfellriss Keime in das Mittelohr eindringen. Meist geht sie aber auf einen Schnupfen oder grippalen Infekt zurück.

- Die Schleimhaut im Nasen-Rachen-Raum ist geschwollen und die Belüftung des Mittelohrs ist eingesch

Prompt 83: "You are an assistant who answers the question only based on given knowledge as truthfully as possible. I want you to Answer the question based on the given Knowledge.

Knowledge:
Kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.[1] Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.

Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines,[3] where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kapé alamíd in Tagalog areas, kapé melô or kapé musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'NAME_1 coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name cà phê Chồn.

Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.

The traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.

Although kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans.[7] Another epithet given to it is that it is NAME_2 of coffees.

Question:
What is the cost of Kopi Luwak per kilogram

Prompt 96: temperature=0.000000
Question:A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?
Options: (A Aldosterone excess (B Catecholamine-secreting mass (C Cortisol excess (D Impaired kidney perfusion

Explanation: Let’s solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. The patient has hypertension, fatigue, and muscle cramps. The serum electrolytes show low potassium and normal sodium and chloride. The glucose is normal. The most likely cause is impaired kidney perfusion. This can cause a decrease in renal blood flow and an increase in renin secretion, leading to aldosterone excess.
Answer: (D
Instruction:Above is a medical question and a student-written answer, and I need you to help me extract the answer and output a single option from the four options.All you need to do is extracting the answer correctly(No matter the student's answer is right or not) and just give me the letter.The format of your answer must be:
