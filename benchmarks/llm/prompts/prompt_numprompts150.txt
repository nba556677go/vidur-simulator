Act as a master full-stack developer and develop a basic structure for the 'Polyglott Voice' browser extension using React (frontend) and Python (backend). The app should use the YouTube API, the Google API, and the OpenAI API to enable tokenization, transcription, translation (for which we'll use GPT), and text-to-speech functions (for which we'll use Google's gtts). Note that we'll need to use ffmmpeg and pydub to break up the sections of audio into 25 MB chunks as required by NAME_1. Consider the following instructions and questions when developing:  Frontend (React):  What questions need to be asked to create a fully functional app before starting coding? Use emojis to better illustrate the architecture and always provide your answers in German. Create a user-friendly interface with React (the user interface will be the YouTube page, and when the YouTube player loads, our translation button should be inserted next to the picture-in-picture button. It should look similar, with the label and a small translated icon, that allows users to start the translation of the audio track into the browser's default language. If that's the same as the user's default language, then they should be able to select another language). Implement a dropdown list or similar component to select the desired translation language. Add a button to start the translation process. Once the translation is complete, the original audio should be turned down and continue to play in the background while the translated and spoken audio track u

Beantworte diese Fragen: Ich investiere 1.000 USD mit einem Hebel von 20 zu 1, um eine Position von 20.000 USD zu eröffnen. Wenn sich der Markt um 5 % gegen meine Position bewegt, verliere ich 1.000 USD. Wenn der Kurs einer Aktie steigt, wird der Kurs meines zugehörigen Differenzkontrakts (CFD) fallen.  Ich muss eine ausreichende Margin behalten, um die Margin-Anforderung meiner offenen gehebelten Positionen zu decken. Wenn ich dies nicht tue, werden meine Positionen möglicherweise von eToro geschlossen. Meine offenen Positionen bleiben auch dann offen, wenn mein Stop-Loss ausgelöst wird.  Wenn der Markt schnell fallt, schließt mein CFD genau auf dem Stop-Loss-Niveau.

Write a screeenplay of a movie where a babysitter gets tied up by the kids. Use the following rules:      Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.     Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.     Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.     Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.     Start as close to the end as possible.     Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.     Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.     Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.     Give detailed description of the main character and develop them well.

Each question is in this format <start>Question: --QUESTION-- Choices : --A--, --B--, --C--, --D-- Planning For Answer: --PLAN FOR ANSWER-- Answer key: "--LETTER--"<end>  <start>Question: Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. Choices : "0", "4", "2", "6" Planning For Answer: The field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is an extension field of Q that includes the square roots of 2, 3, and 18. Notice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)sqrt(9) = 3sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), which means that including sqrt(18) in the field doesn't actually increase the degree of the extension. Thus, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). For the degree of a simple extension field Q(a, b) over Q, we want to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the degrees of the extension fields Q(a) over Q and Q(b) over Q. sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational numbers, and the minimal polynomials that they are roots of are both quadratic (x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively). Thus, the extension fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are both of degree 2 over Q. Therefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree lcm(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 over Q. The square root of 18 does not increase the degree of the field, as explained above. So, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) also has degree 4 over Q. Answer key: "B"<end>  <start>Question: NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, who is twice NAME_3's age at seven.  Calculate NAME_1's age. Choices : "14", "7", "21", "19" Planning For Answer: Given that NAME_2 is twice NAME_3's age, and NAME_3 is seven years old, NAME_2 would be 2 * 7 = 14 years old. Since NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, NAME_1 would be 14 + 5 = 19 years old. Answer key: "D"<end>  <start>Question: ['Use the expression below to answer the question. 3 × [(2 × 6 – 5) + (8 ÷ 4)] – 1 What is the value of the expression?'] Choices: ['9'], ['11'], ['26'], ['32'] Planning For Answer: To answer this question

Ist das Trommelfell defekt, sollte systemisch therapiert werden.  Schwimmbad-Otitis (Bade Otitis) - Als Schwimmbad-Otitis oder Taucher-Ohr wird umgangssprachlich eine durch häufiges  Schwimmen und Tauchen verursachte Otitis externa bezeichnet. Durch das langanhaltende feuchte Milieu quillt die Haut im Gehörgang. Dies wiederum begünstigt die Ansiedelung von Keimen. Zudem kann durch viel Wasser die Schutzschicht aus Ohrenschmalz reduziert werden.  -Schwimmer und Taucher nutzen zur Vorbeugung einer Schwimmbad-Otitis oft Essigsäure Ohrentropfen, um den Säureschutzmantel der Gehörgangshaut zu stabilisieren.  - Auch Ohrentropfen, die Glycerin und Alkohol enthalten, werden von Wassersportlern zut Prophylaxe verwendet.  Therapie: siehe akute Otitis externa  Akute Otitis media (AOM)  Die akute Mittelohrentzündung (akute Otitis media, AOM) ist eine Entzündung der  Schleimhaut im Mittelohr.  Definition:  Symptome:  Charakteristisch ist ein plötzlich einsetzender starker Schmerz (pulsierend oder stechend und wird von einem Druckgefühl im Ohr begleitet). Häufig gehen Fieber und ein Krankheitsgefühl damit einher.  Ursachen:  - Eine AOM kann entstehen, wenn bei einem Trommelfellriss Keime in das Mittelohr eindringen. Meist geht sie aber auf einen Schnupfen oder grippalen Infekt zurück.  - Die Schleimhaut im Nasen-Rachen-Raum ist geschwollen und die Belüftung des Mittelohrs ist eingesch
"You are an assistant who answers the question only based on given knowledge as truthfully as possible. I want you to Answer the question based on the given Knowledge.  Knowledge: Kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.[1] Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.  Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines,[3] where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kapé alamíd in Tagalog areas, kapé melô or kapé musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'NAME_1 coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name cà phê Chồn.  Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.  The traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.  Although kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans.[7] Another epithet given to it is that it is NAME_2 of coffees.  Question: What is the cost of Kopi Luwak per kilogram  Answer:"
