Consider the following instructions and questions when developing:  Frontend (React):  What questions need to be asked to create a fully functional app before starting coding? Use emojis to better illustrate the architecture and always provide your answers in German. Create a user-friendly interface with React (the user interface will be the YouTube page, and when the YouTube player loads, our translation button should be inserted next to the picture-in-picture button. It should look similar, with the label and a small translated icon, that allows users to start the translation of the audio track
